<details>
<summary>What is a look book and how can it benefit my business?</summary>
<br>
A look book is a collection of information that showcases the apprentices and cohorts journey into tech. It contains various information about the apprentices such as background, technical skills, education and how they are progressing. It can benefit your business by presenting your products(the apprentices) or cohorts in a visually appealing way, and can be used for marketing purposes.
